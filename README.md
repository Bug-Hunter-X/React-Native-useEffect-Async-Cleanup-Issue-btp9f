# React Native useEffect Async Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with asynchronous operations.  The problem arises when a component unmounts before an asynchronous operation within the `useEffect` hook completes. This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

The `useEffectAsyncCleanupBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `useEffectAsyncCleanupSolution.js` provides a corrected version that addresses the cleanup issue.

## Problem

The cleanup function in `useEffect` is crucial for canceling ongoing operations and releasing resources when a component unmounts.  However, if the component unmounts before the `async` operation finishes, the cleanup function might not execute, resulting in unintended consequences.

## Solution

The solution involves using a signal or abort controller to ensure the cleanup function is executed properly, regardless of component unmounting.
