This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an async function inside. The problem is that the cleanup function might not be executed properly if the component unmounts before the async operation completes, leading to potential memory leaks and unexpected behavior. This is because the cleanup function in `useEffect` is responsible for canceling any ongoing operations to prevent memory leaks.
